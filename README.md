Colorful Specs is a Google Chrome extension that makes your project specs more readable and colorful. Choose from a variety of given themes to help you read through specs with ease.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository onto your computer, preferrably somewhere where you can leave it for a long time without moving it.

```
git clone https://github.com/insiyab/Colorful-Specs.git
```

If `git` isn't your thing, you can also use the bright green button above that says `Clone or download` to download the zip file.

2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Google Chrome.

3. Turn on `Developer Mode` using the slider in the top right corner, then click `Load Unpacked` on the top left.

4. Navigate to and select the Colorful Specs folder in your computer's file system.

That's it! You should now be able to see the Colorful Specs extension in your Chrome browser.

### Backstory
My name is [Insiya Bambot](http://insiyabambot.wordpress.com/). I created Colorful Specs as I found myself struggling to focus on my computer science projects. The majority of my computer science classes use plain HTML pages to display assignments, and the glare of the white screen made it difficult to parse through the project requirements.

Colorful Specs is inspired by [Rishabh Aggarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabhaggarwal2/)'s [Beautiful Eggert](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beautiful-eggert/gkhkfkioobdgdboaejfjgbefmedmeijh?hl=en) and [Justin Liu](https://jliu.cc/)'s [Vampire Eggert](https://github.com/jl98/VampireEggert). To learn more about the story behind the original Beautiful Eggert, check out Rishabh's [Medium article](https://medium.com/@rishabhaggarwal2/beautiful-eggert-89691d27d3e0).

While the aforementioned projects do make target websites reader-friendly, I wanted to give users the option to switch back and forth between light and dark modes and the option to choose between colorful themes as opposed to grayscale ones. Additionally, I wanted to make sure that these themes were visually accessible to all users.

### Themes

This extension supports several color themes, including both light and dark modes:
* üå≥ Forest
* üéÉ Halloween
* üõ∂ Lagoon
* üåø Minty
* üçâ Watermelon

You can also select 'None' to view the plain HTML page.

I used [Accessible Colors](https://accessible-colors.com) to develop to the best of my ability an AAA compliant design for each of these themes.

Note that the screen may flicker when changing pages. This is because Colorful Specs takes a moment to retrieve the user's currently set theme and clear all other CSS styling from the page.

### Websites

This extension is active on the following domains:
* `web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/*`
* `lasr.cs.ucla.edu/classes/*`
* `isi.deterlab.net/file*`
* `yellowstone.cs.ucla.edu/cs143/*`
* `web.cs.ucla.edu/~ravi/CS134*/assignment*`

All sites on the list will be affected by the same choice of theme.
